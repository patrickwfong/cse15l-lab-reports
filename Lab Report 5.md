# Part 1: Debugging Scenario
**Original student post with a screenshot showing a symptom and a guess as to what the bug might be:**\
\
&emsp; I'm trying to write a Java program that reads a list of numbers from a text file, then calculates and outputs the mean of the numbers.\
&emsp; The Java file is called ```MeanCalc.java```. The text file to be read is in a different directory called ```data```.\
\
&emsp; Here is a screenshot of the directory structure:\
&emsp; ![Image](lab5ss1.png)\
&emsp; Here is a screenshot of the failure-inducing input and symptom:\
&emsp; ![Image](lab5ss2.png)\
\
&emsp; I'm not sure whether my program is calculating the average incorrectly or reading input from the wrong file. Any ideas?\
